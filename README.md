## Purpose

  There is a myriad of weather and climate data describing the physical parameters this planet describing now, in the past and in the near or far future. Only a subset is actually useful for the general public. Temperature at 2 meters, wind at 10 meters, sea surface level are examples to plan ahead. An astonishing amount of these data sets are in the public domain or otherwise available without a commercial handshake. 

  So, what are the essential datasets giving you an advantage? Actually it depends on your intents. Do you want to harvest some extra kilo  watt of your solar energy installation or is it just the umbrellla or not question?
